# Advent of code
My solutions for the advent of code calendar.

## Input files
To get the necessary input files, visit the [advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/), log in and download the input files
for the day you want to run. The URL follows this pattern: `https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/{day}/input`.
The download is not included in the scripts to avoid unnecessary requests to the server.

## How to run
Each day is a separate python file. To run a day, simply run the file with python3. For example:
```python
python 2023/day_01_puzzle_1.py
```
Please note that a few puzzles require additional dependencies. These are listed in the requirements.txt file.

If you want to install those and/or run the included linters (black, flake8 and isort), install the dependencies from the file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
